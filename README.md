# PopScaleCompartmentModels
R scripts and xlsx files for compartmental models of populations varying in scale.

These files were used in support of the paper:
Watts, Christopher, Chattoe-Brown, Edmund, Droy, Laurence, Gilbert, Nigel, Ladley, Daniel, Robertson, Duncan, (submitted to RofASSS) "The role of population scale  in compartmental models of Covid-19 transmission".

They implement several types of compartmental model of disease transmission (SI, SIR, SEIR). As they illustrate, the times of occurrence of epidemic events such as peak cases are sensitive to the size of population and the number of initial seed infections.
